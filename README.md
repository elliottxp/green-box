# Green Box

Green Box is a simple app designed to inspire kindness and introduce positive moments into your daily routine. In a world where the average person spends 3 hours a day on their phone and 5 hours indoors—often sitting inactive—Green Box encourages you to "Plan for Kindness" by breaking these patterns with thoughtful, actionable ideas.

## Features

- **Default Ideas**: Pre-curated suggestions for incorporating activity into your day (e.g., small acts of generosity, outdoor breaks, or mindful moments).
- **Your Ideas**: Personalize your plan by adding and tracking your own custom ideas.
- **Simple, Intuitive Interface**: Easy-to-use prompts to reflect, plan, and act perfect for busy lives.
- **Calendar Invites**: Add the idea as an event to your calendar with ics. 

## How It Works

1. **Plan**: Browse default ideas or create your own to add "different moments" to your day.
2. **Act**: Implement small, kind actions that reduce inactivity and foster positivity.
3. **Track Progress**: In your calendar, build a habit of kindness one idea at a time.

## Getting Started

1. Visit [green-box.app](https://www.green-box.app) to explore the platform.
2. Start with a default idea or jot down one of your own under "Your Ideas."
3. Draw from the box to randomise an idea, then plan by adding to your calendar.
